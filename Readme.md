# Monchacos Front End Project
## Use of Angular JS documented

This project is the result of a two day introduction I made myself to Angular.js. 
I needed to update the front code of my Drupal personal page, and as Drupal is not a MVC it was going to be a hard work.
On the other hand, drupal has easy integration of modules, so you can set up a Rest api in a few minutes.
After setting up the REST API I coded the front end and had some fun with Angular.

You can find documented code along the project and links to the original pieces of information that are on the internet.

Here you have a kick start of the first resources you will find helpfull.
